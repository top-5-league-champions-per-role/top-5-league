# Using Flake8 as a Python linter
http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/
If you are using Atom, you can install Flake8 as an extension. Otherwise, you can type in `flake8 your_python_file.py` and it will print out the lint messages.

# Useful git commands
Git can be downloaded [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Useful git commands are:
  1. `git pull` - Use this before you code. Will pull the latest updates to your local directory
  2. `git status` - See all files that you changed.
  3. `git add *` - Add all files that were changed and get them ready to be pushed to the repository.
  4. `git commit -m "insert commit message here"` - Commit the changes while adding a useful comment to what you changed.
  5. `git push` - Push all the committed changes
  6. `git reset hard` - If you screw up, use this to delete EVERYTHING and go back to where you last pulled. WARNING: This WILL delete any changes that you made!
  7. `ls` - List all files in current directory
  8. `cat filename` - Display the contents of <filename> on the terminal.
  9. `cd directory_path` - Change your current directory to directory_path
